This is all jargon that can be deleted at any time

//Holding this 
If using the gravity idea,
we will need to use the  Phaser matter physics, as it add friction air resistance and gravity

//General high level structuring 

for the generation of the runners world it seems like an obvious option would 
be to build objects ahead of the camera, and delete objects as they leave the camera

obstacle creation can be done in the same loop (most likely the main play scene)

scaling of difficulty/ other variables may be tied to speed/time passed,
with (switch statements?) controlling functions responsible for game parts. 

one thing to consider is the variance that comes with the ability to speed up
and slow down. 

There seems to be a lot of camera controls 
I think that a "factory" might be the best way to generate the map
Another strategy might be to have a few tile maps that are prebuilt 
that we  generate, but I think that it might be more hassle that I think

"tumble"
