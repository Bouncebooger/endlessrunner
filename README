<Creative Tilt Justification>
Does your game...
...do something technically interesting? Are you particularly proud of a programming technique you implemented? Did you look beyond the class examples and learn how to do something new?

...have a great visual style? Does it use music or art that you're particularly proud of? Are you trying something new or clever with the endless runner form?
    In the game, the player is a slug falling down a tree in trying to avoid instant death. The hovering menacing threat is the bird predator trying to catch
    a snack and the threat from below are the platforms. Depending on the velocity the slug is falling, it can splat on a platform by falling onto it at full speed.
    The visual effects used to portray these endings are two death animations where when the player and predator collide the player is sliced in half while when the 
    players falls on to a platform at full velocity then the player ruptures into a blob. It was the first time I made game art so I had fun trying to 
    animate these sprites and visually portray how these objects look while in active use by the player (e.g. breaking spider webs to indicate collision and slow down; leaves
    shaking from being bumped into).
